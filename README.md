# force_facebook
Facebook frequently automatically forces users to view their news feed in their Top Stories view regardless of user settings. This open source extension will take as many steps as possible to ensure that your feed always displays in Most Recent.  

The extension works initially by automatically apply a query string to the end of the Facebook URL to force stories in chronological order. It will also append that same query string to the end of the Home button as well as the Facebook icon in the top left.
